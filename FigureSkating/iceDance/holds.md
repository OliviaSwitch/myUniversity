1. Hand-in-Hand Hold
	- Facing in same direction – The partners face in the same direction and are skating side by side or one behind the other with their arms extended and their hands clasped. A variation of this is the  arm-in-arm side by side hold;
	- 手拉手握法；面朝同一方向 - 男女伴面朝同一个方向，并排或一前一后滑行，手臂伸展，双手紧握。这种握法的一种变化是手挽手的肩并肩握法

2. Closed or Waltz Hold – The partners are directly opposite each other. One partner faces forward while the other partner faces backward. The Man’s right hand is placed firmly on his partner’s back at the shoulder blade with the elbow raised and the arm bent sufficiently to hold the Woman close to him. The left hand of the Woman is placed  at/on the shoulder of the Man so that her arm rests comfortably, elbow to elbow, on his upper arm. The left arm of the Man and the right arm of the Woman are extended comfortably at shoulder height. Their shoulders remain parallel.
  - 闭式或华尔兹握法；男女伴正面相对。一方面向前方，另一方面向后方。男伴的右手紧贴在同伴的背部肩胛骨处，肘部抬起，手臂充分弯曲使女伴紧贴。女伴的左手放在男伴的肩上，手臂能舒适地靠在他的上臂，肘对肘。男伴左臂和女伴右臂舒适地伸出，与肩同高。他们的肩膀保持平行。

3. Open or Foxtrot Hold – The hand and arm holds are similar to those of the Closed or Waltz Hold. The partners simply turn slightly away from each other so that they both face in the same direction
  - 开式或狐步握法；手与手臂的握法类似于闭式或华尔兹式握法。男女伴只是彼此略微偏离，使他们都面对同一个方向。

4. Outside or Tango Hold – The partners face in opposite directions – one partner skating forward; the other partner backward. However, unlike the Closed Hold, the partners are offset with the Man to the right or left of the Woman so that the front of his hip is in line with the front of her corresponding hip. Tight hip-to-hip position is undesirable since it impedes flow.
  - 外侧或探戈握法；男女伴面向的方向相反 - 一位向前滑行；另一位向后滑行。但不同于闭式握法，男女伴的位置相错，男伴在女伴的右或左边，使得男伴与女伴相应的髋部前部呈一条直线。紧绷的髋对髋姿势是不可取的，这会阻碍流动。

5. Kilian Hold – The partners face in the same direction with the Woman to the right of the Man and his right shoulder behind her left. The left arm of the Woman is extended across the front of the Man’s body to hold his left hand. His right arm crosses behind the Woman’s back to clasp her right hand. Both right hands rest over her hip bone.
  - 基里安握法；男女伴面朝同一方向，女伴在男伴的右边，男伴的右肩在女伴左肩的后面。女伴的左臂伸展从前面越过男伴的身体，握住他的左手。他的右臂越过女伴的后背，握住她的右手。两只手都在她的髋骨上方。

6. Reversed Kilian Hold – This hold is similar to the Kilian Hold but with the Woman at the Man’s left.
  - 反基里安式握法；此握法与基里安握法相似，但女伴在男伴的左边。

7. Open Kilian Hold – The Man’s left hand holds the Woman’s left hand, with his right hand resting over the Woman’s left hip or behind her back. The Woman’s right arm is extended. This hold may also be reversed.
  - 开式基里安握法；男伴的左手握住女伴的左手，右手放在女伴的左髋部或后背。女伴的右臂伸展。这种握法也可能被撤销。

8. Crossed Kilian Hold – The Woman’s left arm is extended across the front of the Man’s body to his left hand, while his right arm is extended across in front of her body with both partners’ right hands resting clasped over her hip. This hold may also be reversed.
  - 交叉基里安握法；女伴的左臂伸展从前面越过男伴的身体，握住他的左手，而他的右臂展从前面越过女伴的身体，双方的右手紧握置于髋部上方。这种握法也可以被反式。
